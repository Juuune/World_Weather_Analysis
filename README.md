# World_Weather_Analysis

### Overview 

#### Background and purpose of the analysis
Our clent help answering a question: How might we provide real-time suggestions for our client’s ideal vacation spot? My first task was to define what you meant by “ideal.” 
So, over lots of considerations it's defined "that were (1) within a given range of latitude and longitude and that (2) provided the right kind of weather for the client.

#### Techniques used
- Python with pandas, numpy and scipy.stats for data analysis <br/>
- citipy and Numpy to generate random vacation location <br/>
- Open Weather Map API to request current weather data <br/>
- Gmaps with heatmap layer and marker for world weather data visualization <br/>
- jupyter notebook, git
