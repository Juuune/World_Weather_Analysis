# World_Weather_Analysis

### Overview 

#### Background and purpose of the analysis
Good thing you got your repo set up and out of the way prior to that kickoff meeting. This project is going to be no joke, but it should be a lot of fun.
At the most fundamental level, Jack needs help answering a question: How might we provide real-time suggestions for our client’s ideal hotels? Your first task was to define what you meant by “ideal.” So, over the course of the conversation, you narrowed that to hotels that were (1) within a given range of latitude and longitude and that (2) provided the right kind of weather for the client.

#### Techniques used
- Python with pandas, numpy and scipy.stats for data analysis <br/>
- citipy and Numpy to generate random vacation location <br/>
- Open Weather Map API to request current weather data <br/>
- Gmaps with heatmap layer and marker for world weather data visualization <br/>
- jupyter notebook, git
